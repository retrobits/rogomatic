Rog-O-Matic was the "automatic rogue player for the eighties".

It was originally written by * Andrew Appel * Guy Jacobson * Leonard Hamey * Michael L. Mauldin (http://robot-club.com/lti/)

and described in the paper "ROG-O-MATIC: A Belligerent Expert System" (http://robot-club.com/lti/pub/rgm84.html)

I stumbled upon the program and wanted to see it run, but unfortunately no one had updated it to work on modern unices, so I took on the task.

When originally developed it worked with Rogue 3.6, 5.2 and 5.3. My update currently works with a slightly modified version of Rogue 3.6 from http://rogue.rogueforge.net/home/, most of the time. Given some time I will hopefully get it working with version 5.4 since 5.2 and 5.3 do not seem to have source code available. This may require some tinkering as it never worked with 5.4.
